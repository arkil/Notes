Hcatalog  : 
--> Share Data structure with external system 
--> Provide Access to Hive meta store , so other tools can read and write to hive's warehouse.

Partitioning: 
--> Partition is created for unique value of coloumn.
--> It eliminates data base on where clause
--> Helps to execute faster on basis of common range filtering 
--> Prune data when executing query for fast processing
--> Dynamic Partition : --> Hive automatically identifies partition
                        --> Used for ETL data flow pipeline
                        --> Complete data is read and partitioned through Map reduce job 
--> Static Partition : --> Requires partition name during Insert statement
                       --> Used for loading large files (faster than dynamic partiton)
                       --> Partition is added to the table, file is moved into the static partition
                       
Bucketing:
--> Organize data inside partition
--> Helps in joining columns 
--> Partition is directory and buckets are files inside that
--> Buckets can be limited to a specific
