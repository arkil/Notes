# Evaluation Metric 


## Confusion Matrix 


|		 |Guessed Positive| Guessed Negative |
|--------|----------------| ----------------|
|Positive|True Positive   | False Negative	|
|Negative|False Positive  | True Negative	|


* Type 1 Error (False Positive)
* Type 2 Error (False Negative)

## Accuracy 

* accuracy = (True positive + True Negative ) /total
* Not used for credit card fraudulent kind of cases
 
## Precision

* Precision = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False positive) 
* Spam Detector needs to be high precision model

## Recall

* Recall = (True Positive) /(True Positive + False Negative)
* Medical model needs to be high recall

## Receiver Operator Characteristic 

* The ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of any binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.

## F1 Score

* F-score is a simple formula to gather the scores of precision and recall
